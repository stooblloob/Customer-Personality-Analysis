## Introduction
This is my first collaborative data science project from my senior year of undergrad at the University of California, Riverside. We conducted research on the characteristic and fruit-purchasing habits of a business's customers with the goal of being able to model the traits of the ideal customer for this business to further market fruit towards. 

The dataset we utilized can be found on Kaggle by Dr. Omar Romero-Hernandez of Berkeley Haas School of Business titled "Customer Personality Analysis". The dataset itself is an analysis of a company's ideal customers. This allows the understanding of consumer habits and profiles in order to help market products towards group that are most likely to be customers. 

## Research Questions
**Main Research Question:** What characteristics makes someone more likely to spend more on fruits? 

**Subquestions:** 
1. Does the level of education have an effect in purchasing more on fruit?
2. What age group purchased the most fruit on average? 
3. Are married people more likely to spend more on fruits?
4. Is there a relationship betweenincome and the amount spent on fruit? 
5. Does the number of kids one has at home affect how much they spend on fruit?
